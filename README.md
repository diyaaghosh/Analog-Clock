#  Analog Clock GUI – Made with Python

A simple and elegant analog clock built using Python’s GUI toolkit. This project was made just for fun, to practice working with time, graphics, and GUI design.

##  Features

- Real-time clock updates  
- Hour, minute, and second hands  
- Clean and minimal analog design  
- Easy to run and modify  

---

##  Built With

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI components
- **math** – for angle calculations
- **time** – for fetching current time

---

##  Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher recommended).

Install required dependencies (Tkinter is usually preinstalled with Python):

```bash
pip install tk
```
 How to Run
Clone the repository and run the Python file:
```
git clone https://github.com/diyaaghosh/analog-clock.git
cd analog-clock-gui
python analog_clock.py
```
#### How It Works
The clock face is drawn using canvas shapes.

The hour, minute, and second hands are drawn as lines.

Every 100 milliseconds, the time is fetched, and the hands are rotated accordingly.

#### Customization Ideas
Add digital time display

Customize themes (dark mode, neon, etc.)

Add ticking sound or animations

Export as a desktop widget
